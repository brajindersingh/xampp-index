# xampp-index
Modified index.php of xampp to show the files in the htdocs folder instead of taking the user to phpmyadmin when localhost is typed in the address bar.

Installation:
- Make sure you rename and keep a backup of your original index.php file in the htdocs folder.
- Just download and copy-paste the contents in the htdocs folder of your xampp installtion. It contains an img folder which has the background image for the main window and also a xampp-js folder which has the jquery library file, which is neccessary in case you are not connected to the internet.

That's it. Just copy paste and enjoy the new features like listing all files and directories, and insta-searching through them.
